## Overview

Welcome to my very first project using **R**! ðŸš€ This project dives into understanding fuel consumption in vehicles by analyzing the well-known `mtcars` dataset. The goal was to explore how different vehicle features influence fuel efficiency through multiple regression and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

## Whatâ€™s Inside?

- **Exploratory Data Analysis**  
  Getting to know the dataset through summary statistics, correlations, and visualizations to uncover patterns and insights.

- **Multiple Regression Modeling**  
  Building and comparing different regression models â€” both with all variables and after applying variable selection techniques â€” to predict fuel consumption.

- **Testing with a New Observation**  
  Adding a new vehicle entry to see how it impacts the model coefficients and overall predictions.

- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**  
  Using PCA for dimensionality reduction to simplify the data and visualize relationships between variables and vehicles.

- **Regression on Principal Components**  
  Developing a regression model based on PCA components and comparing its performance against the traditional regression approach.

## Why This Project?

As my first experience with R, this project was a great opportunity to learn and apply key statistical and data analysis techniques while getting familiar with Râ€™s powerful ecosystem. It was both challenging and rewarding!

## Tools and Technologies

- **Language:** R  
- **Key R Packages:** `ggplot2`, `FactoMineR`, `factoextra`, `car`, `MASS`, among others.

## How to Reproduce

1. Load the built-in `mtcars` dataset in R.  
2. Run the provided R scripts for descriptive analysis and visualization.  
3. Fit multiple regression models with and without variable selection.  
4. Add the additional data point and observe changes in model parameters.  
5. Perform PCA to explore data structure and visualize it.  
6. Fit regression on principal components and compare results.

All scripts are well-commented and included in this repository.
